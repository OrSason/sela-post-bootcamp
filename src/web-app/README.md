# Awesome Web App

## Description

- This is a demo web application written in go that uses the native golang http server to serve a basic static html page that listens on port 3000.
- In addition, the server accepts GET requests to the "/hello" path and POST requests to the "/form" path
- To simplify the use of the application the UI provides a button to redirect you to the "hello" api and a form to make a post request from the page itself
- The application takes the index.html file from a fixed path located in "/web/static/index.html"
